        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>I love fishing. So did my grandfather. I can remember getting up at the crack of dawn, sleepy eyed but excited. Driving to grandfatherâ€™s favorite fishing hole and finding the perfect spot along the bank. Quietly sitting there listening to the Whip-poor-wills calling to one another. I still remember the mist rising from the lake as the frogs join in the early morning song. I miss those days with grandfather. They are some of my favorite times. This recipe always reminds me of those times for some reason. I hope you like the recipe as much as I.</p>

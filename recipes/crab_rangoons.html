    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I was with my Grandfather on a trip to the grocery store top pick up the ingredients for dinner.</p>
    <p>I was in the backseat with my feet sticking out the window. </p>
    <p>Unfortunately for me it started to rain and sure enough my Grandfather decided to roll up the windows.</p>
    <p>I guess I wasn't quick enough because my toe got stuck in the window. I screamed..it hurt like hell. Luckily my grandfather immediately rolled the window back down and my toe was rescued. It was not broken or cut...just bruised.</p>
    <p>Grandfather felt really bad. He made it up to me with a very fine dinner. Which included Crab Rangoon which is what we had gone to the grocery store to pick up the ingredients for.</p>
